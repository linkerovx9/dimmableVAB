dimmableVAB
===========

This modification was created for Kerbal Space Program v0.23.5. It is still a work in progress, so please forward any issues to me on the KSP forums.


How it works
============
At the time of creating this readme file, the process of how this mod works is fairly simplistic. It will remove *most* of the VAB/SPH background, turn off most lighting, and turn on all lights on the vessel. Upon pressing the key again, it will reset the VAB/SPH and reload your ship.

Usage
===========

The current default key is "L". Use it in the SPH or VAB.


To Do
===========

Integrate with blizzy's toolbar
Adjustable controls
Keep VAB/SPH background and dim it instead
Work out any bugs
Code cleanup

Change Log
===========

v0.1 - Initial release.
